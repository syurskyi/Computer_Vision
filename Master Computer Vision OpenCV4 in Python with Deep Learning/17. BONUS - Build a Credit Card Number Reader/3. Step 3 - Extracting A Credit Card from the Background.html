<h4><strong>Extracting a Credit Card</strong></h4><p><br></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This example extracts only 12 of the 16 digits because, this is a working credit card :) </p><p><br></p><p>The code below does contains the functions we use to do the following:</p><p><br></p><p>1. It loads the image, image we're using our mobile phone camera to take this picture. (Note: ideally place the card on a contrasting background)</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-04_06-31-06-6e0ea340958fbce841a07b78d48215f2.JPG"></figure><p>2. We use Canny Edge detection to identify the edges of card</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-04_06-31-32-83ee0c50b79d9008b9823bfa98da7be9.JPG"></figure><p>3. We using cv2.findContours() to extract the largest contour (which we assume will be the credit card)</p><p><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-04_06-31-14-fee84b836e81142e2829fb266dec2244.JPG"></p><p>4. This is where we use the function <strong>four_point_transform() </strong>and <strong>order_points() </strong>to adjust the perspective of the card. It creates a top-down type view that is useful because:</p><ul><li><p>It standardizes the view of the card so that the credit card digits are always roughly in the same area.</p></li><li><p>It removes/reduces skew and warped perspectives from the image when taken from a camera. All cameras unless taken exactly top down, will introduce some skew to text/digits. This is why scanners always produce more realistic looking images.</p></li></ul><p><img height="214" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-04_06-31-39-48dc83992e0158333fdffecfbeeaf78b.JPG" width="340"><img height="214" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-04_06-31-44-5c9e8bd1c39030b2f38f2dd72936c08d.JPG" width="341"></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import cv2
